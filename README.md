# AI Feedback Analyzer

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
An intelligent tool designed to process, analyze, and derive actionable insights from customer feedback across various channels. This project aims to help businesses understand their customers better and make data-driven decisions.

## Short Description

In today's competitive environment, understanding customer voice is paramount. The AI Feedback Analyzer addresses the critical challenge of feedback overload by leveraging Artificial Intelligence, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate the analysis of customer reviews, comments, and other textual feedback. It aims to move beyond basic sentiment analysis to provide deeper insights into key topics, emerging trends, and the underlying drivers of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

This initial version serves as a foundational MVP, demonstrating core analytical capabilities.

## Current Features (MVP)

*(Customize this section based on what your "previous version" actually does. Below are common MVP features for such a project.)*

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies input feedback text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
* **Topic/Keyword Extraction:** Identifies key topics or keywords mentioned in the feedback.
* **Manual Text Input:** Allows users to paste text directly for analysis.
* **(Optional) Basic File Upload:** Allows users to upload a simple text or CSV file containing feedback for batch analysis.
* **Core AI Logic Prototyped:** Likely built using [Langflow](https://langflow.org/) for visual AI pipeline construction, leveraging models like Google's Gemini.

## Technology Stack (Assumed)

*(Adjust based on your actual stack)*

* **Backend:** Python
* **AI/NLP Core:** Langflow, [Google Generative AI API (Gemini)](https://ai.google.dev/), or other LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI)
* **(Optional) Frontend/UI:** Streamlit or Flask (if a simple web interface was built)
* **Libraries:** Standard Python data science/NLP libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn` if used), `requests`.

## Setup & Installation

*(Provide specific instructions for your project)*

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.8+
    * Langflow (if running/modifying Langflow components directly: `pip install langflow`)
    * Access to an LLM API (e.g., Google AI Studio API Key for Gemini)
    * Git

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your repository)*

4.  **Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    * Add your API keys and other configurations:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
        # OTHER_API_KEYS or configurations if needed
        ```
    *(Ensure your code loads these, e.g., using `python-dotenv`)*

## How to Use

*(Provide specific instructions for your project's current version)*

**If primarily a Langflow export:**

1.  Ensure Langflow is running.
2.  Import the `flow.json` (or similarly named) file into your Langflow interface.
3.  Interact with the flow through the Langflow chat interface:
    * Provide customer feedback text as input when prompted.
    * Observe the analyzed output (e.g., sentiment, topics).

**If a standalone Python script or simple web app:**

1.  Run the main application script:
    ```bash
    python app.py  # Or your main script name
    ```
2.  If it's a web app, open your browser and navigate to the specified local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to input feedback and view analysis.

**Example Input:**

> "The new user interface is very intuitive, but the app seems to crash frequently on my Android device."

**Expected MVP Output (Example):**

> Sentiment: Mixed/Neutral (or separate sentiment for clauses)
> Topics: User Interface, App Crash, Android Device

## Project Worth & Value Proposition

The AI Feedback Analyzer aims to provide significant value by:

* **Transforming Data Overload into Actionable Intelligence:** Addresses the "actionability gap" where businesses collect vast amounts of feedback but struggle to extract timely, meaningful insights.
* **Enhancing Customer Understanding:** Provides deeper insights into customer needs, pain points, emotions, and expectations, leading to improved products and services.
* **Driving Data-Driven Decisions:** Empowers Product Managers, CX Teams, Marketers, and Support Leads with objective data to inform strategies and prioritize actions.
* **Improving Efficiency:** Automates the laborious and time-consuming process of manual feedback analysis, saving significant time and resources.
* **Competitive Advantage:** Enables businesses to react faster to market trends and customer demands, fostering customer loyalty and reducing churn.
* **Market Need:** The demand for sophisticated feedback analytics is rapidly growing, driven by the focus on customer-centricity and advancements in AI, especially in dynamic markets like India.

## Future Ideas & Roadmap Highlights

This project has a significant potential for growth. Based on comprehensive market research, future enhancements will focus on delivering a truly differentiated and indispensable tool:
